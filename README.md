twenty
======

A drupal theme based on HTML5 Up's Twenty code.

NOTE: You must have at least jQuery 1.7. This theme was developed and tested with jQuery 1.8. I believe any jQuery version above 1.8 will cause errors because jQuery removed the browser property in 1.9. Install and configure the jQuery Update module to get a more up-to-date version of jQuery on your Drupal site.
